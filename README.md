Audio Input Selection
===

Simple `getUserMedia()` audio input device selection.

Setting in Chrome: [chrome://settings/content/microphone](chrome://settings/content/microphone) or [chrome://settings/content/camera](chrome://settings/content/camera).

Running:

    npm install
    node index.js

Suggest to use `ngrok` to run it on public Internet. You must allow microphone permissions before device names can be displayed.
